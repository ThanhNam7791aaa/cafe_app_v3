# Performance Optimization for Cafe App Dashboard

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to reduce the number of database queries when loading the admin dashboard.

## Problem Analysis
The original dashboard was making 8 separate database queries:
1. User authentication query
2. Total orders count
3. Today's revenue calculation
4. Total menu items count
5. Total customers count
6. Latest 5 orders
7. Top selling items statistics
8. All menu items (for menu management)

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Database Indexes
Added strategic indexes to improve query performance:
- `idx_orders_order_date` - For date-based queries
- `idx_orders_status` - For status filtering
- `idx_orders_date_status` - Composite index for common query patterns
- `idx_order_items_item_name` - For item name aggregations
- `idx_order_items_quantity` - For quantity-based sorting
- `idx_users_username` - For user authentication

### 2. Query Optimization
**Before**: 3 separate queries for basic stats
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(total_amount), 0.0) FROM orders WHERE ...
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers
```

**After**: 1 optimized query
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(o) as totalOrders,
    COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN o.orderDate >= ?1 AND o.orderDate < ?2 AND o.status = 'COMPLETED' THEN o.totalAmount ELSE 0 END), 0.0) as todayRevenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer) as totalCustomers
FROM Order o
```

### 3. Caching Implementation
- Added `@Cacheable` annotation to `getDashboardStatistics()` method
- Cache key: `'dashboard'`
- Cache eviction on order creation/updates using `@CacheEvict`
- Enabled caching with `@EnableCaching` in main application

### 4. Performance Benefits
- **Reduced queries**: From 8 queries to 6 queries (33% reduction)
- **Faster dashboard loading**: Cached results for repeated requests
- **Better database performance**: Strategic indexes improve query execution time
- **Automatic cache invalidation**: Dashboard updates when new orders are created

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. `OrderRepository.java` - Added optimized query method
2. `OrderService.java` - Updated to use optimized query and added caching
3. `CafeAppVer1Application.java` - Enabled caching
4. `V2__Add_Performance_Indexes.sql` - Database migration for indexes

### Cache Configuration
- Cache name: `dashboardStats`
- Cache key: `'dashboard'`
- Eviction: Automatic on order creation/update
- TTL: Default Spring Cache TTL (configurable)

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Monitor cache hit rates in production
- Consider adjusting cache TTL based on usage patterns
- Review index performance with database query analyzer
- Consider adding more specific indexes if new query patterns emerge

## Future Optimizations
1. **Pagination**: Implement pagination for large order lists
2. **Async Loading**: Load dashboard components asynchronously
3. **Database Views**: Create materialized views for complex aggregations
4. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connection pool settings
